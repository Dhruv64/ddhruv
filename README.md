topic of the project: a GUI program to send personalised bulk emails using tkinter library in python
I worked on a the frontend and backend of a program that sends personalised bulk emails i.e. includes their names etc. This was done by using an excel file and a text file(containing the email body) uploaded by the user in the program.
I used tkinter to make the GUI of this program. 
I used frames in tkinter to make different pages like welcome page, file upload page and email and password page. 
I used various other tkinter functions like buttons, message boxes to show warning if the entered email and password is incorrect etc. and progressbars to make the program more user friendly.
the program would search for a column named "emails" and mails all of them
